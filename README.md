Abstract
--------

The sofware library includes a set of classes for implementing compression of vector large data streams using sparse coding in combination with streaming coreset computation. It also incldues an application program that demonstrates the compress/decompression of scalar volumetric data.

The code has been used, in particular, for implementing systems for real-time exploration of massive static and time-varying rectilinear scalar volumes. See references below.

Using the code
--------------

See INSTALL file for installation instructions and individual class documentation for more info.
Additional documentation is availabile in Deliverable D6.2 on the [TDM project deliverables](http://www.tdm-project.it/en/results/public-deliverables/) web site.
